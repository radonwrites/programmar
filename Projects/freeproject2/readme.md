The 10-1 free project reminded me of elementary school, where we would write poems into (usually representative) shapes, and of the images people make with keyboard characters on the computer. I thought it would be fun to try to recreate that and add some randomization or mathematic modification to see what shapes or patterns it might make.

Unfortunately, at this time I am quite stuck. I started by trying to make a grid of characters with a nested loop as is done with pixels, but I couldn't get a grid or image from it - the image.new was giving me a lot of errors and I wasn't sure if the code was even going to correctly interpret a character as a pixel in the way I wanted it to.

I decided to try just making an image. One color at first, and then some sort of pattern (like stripes). Making a color block was totally fine, but multiple attempts to modify the color within the for loops were largely unsuccessful. I'm not even sure why it doesn't do anything sometimes, as I am able to resolve most errors, but when there are no errors I have a harder time figuring out what isn't working the way I want. 

So, here are the (updated) steps I was planning for this:
1. Create an image cell-by-cell (done)
2. Create a pattern or modification to function, different from the gradient, noise, or single pixel line as done before (not yet successful)
3. Translate function into one that creates a grid of letters (nope)
