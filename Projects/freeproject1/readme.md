I decided to modify the starteriest of starter programs for Free Project 7-2 - "Hello, World"
Monfort goes into some depth regarding alternates and limitations to "hello world" as a starter program, and asks if your computer can "provoke and offend just by printing a string". This question and the question of whether the computer has social standing reminded me of Hal from 2001: A Space Odyssey (perhaps also because Odysseus was mentioned shortly before in the text?) and the classic exchange between Hal and Dave about opening doors. What makes Hal's lines particularly effective is its reference to the human, Dave. With my program, whoever runs it would be Dave, in a sense, so I wanted to create a greeting that required input from the user, and have the computer respond with that input. This would also expand the notion of a greeting into an introductory exchange between human and computer.
I wanted to make the input easier/more natural for the user, in the way that the quiz questions for "input_infinite.py" worked where one could just type the number as an answer and it would respond. I wasn't quite about to figure that out yet.
