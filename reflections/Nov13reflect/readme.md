The excercise here was deceptively challenging. I tried to create a diagonal line using only reference to the chapter 12 exercise and what I remembered of making lines in python. I figured I'd try for loops, but since the book is using java in this section, I think I've gotten the syntax confused. There's also probably an easier way to do this than what I'm doing (I do know line() exists but I got the impression from the book that I should try without using that). It doesn't work yet, but I do want to try to figure it out without looking anything up.
I'm finding Processing to be a nice melding of what I've learned so far in physical computing and in this class. I appreciate how easy it is to create and run interactive programs, and the library of examples provided helps give some ideas of what can be done.
I need to do more research into AR for my final project, unfortunately I did not get to that as much as I would have liked this week, but I hope to start experimenting with it over the weekend.
