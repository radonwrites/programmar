For this week I mostly just dipped my digits into the Processing waters through Ch 12 by calculating the mean and median for a list of values. Overall, there weren't too many problems, though I found myself stuck overcomplicating the median problem for a bit, thinking about how we did the 5 longest sentences in a body of text and trying to figure out how to use a for loop to do something along those lines, but stop at the halfway point. 
All in all, my brain is starting to feel a bit saturated, and that frustrates me. I like the challenge and I don't often feel this way, which is an overall good sign? But, I also feel like I should be absorbing this more quickly than I am at the moment, hence the frustration. I like Processing because it is similar to Arduino, and in many big picture ways learning several languages at once is beneficial. However, I find myself struggling a bit with the languages I need to teach (HTML, CSS, SASS) as everything can get a bit muddled when tired and troubleshooting student problems. 
In terms of outside projects and the like, I recently spoke with Emily Johnson about her BeadED Adventures, and that conversation, along with my own teaching (and learning) of code, just has me thinking about the ways in which we can make core concepts (like conditional logic) more accessible, and what that would look like for different age groups.
