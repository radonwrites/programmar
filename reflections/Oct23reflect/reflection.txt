This week I looked at some Digital Humanities projects listed through different universities. 
One was about creating 3D models for Egyptian coffins that could ideally/ultimately be explored by the public. If done well, this could be an excellent way to help bring people closer to experiences of the past, using technology as a means to replicate or lessen the divide between viewer/participant and the people that may have once interacted with these artifacts long before. It reminds me of a talk I went to at GDC about historical narratives, where the speaker advocated for evoking the feelings and emotions people of the time may have felt, and prioritizing that over factual, historical accuracy - especially as those details are cast in a different light/take on different meaning over time.

I'm interested in this idea of creating 3D models ( related as we move into pixels/images) to allow people to interact with objects they would not be able to otherwise. I think the experience could be enhanced if this were to be VR, with a tangible object replicating the feel of a coffin so that participants can have multiple sensory inputs bring them closer to the artifacts.
