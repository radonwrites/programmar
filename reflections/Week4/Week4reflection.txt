I decided to do Free Project 7-1 for my weekly exercise. Unfortunately, I haven't quite gotten it to work the way I want yet. 
I added on to the 'phrase' function so that, theoretically, if the text is about a person, then more content is added.
I'm not sure why the conditional that already existed works but mine does not (and I'm not getting an error) - instead of only adding the extra content 
within the 'if/elif' rules, it is applied every time.

This project led me to do a little research on generative art, and I came across an interview with Manolo Gamboa Naon, a generative artist who uses Processing to create 
compelling visual displays. One of the more memorable points of the interview was the central role errors take in the creation process.
I think one mental hurdle I need(ed) to overcome in coding was the fear of getting errors. The computer or program is not (probably) going to explode, and I am not a failure.
In learning to code, it's easy to get errors and I've honestly found it's better to get them. I want to understand why something does or doesn't work, and it's easier for me to test these concepts through errors and constant testing.
Generative art was a fun way to make this connection, as I've learned over the years to accept mistakes (or, 'happy accidents') in other mediums, and often they lead to a better outcome than originally planned. However, I realized I had not fully applied this notion to coding until recently.
