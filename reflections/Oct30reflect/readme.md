Was on the struggle bus for most of this week, particularly regarding the lab 2 assignments and Ch 10 and 11 in general. I used to work often in Photoshop and Illustrator, and I still do digital illustrations and graphic design, so I have a pretty good understanding of some core concept at play. I'm not sure if prior knowledge helped or hurt in this case, but overall some aspects of the pixel manipulation felt frustratingly difficult to grasp.

Thinking more on it, I remember when I first started using Photoshop in high school, and being blown away by some of the work people were doing. It all felt entirely magical - how are they making it look like the entire ocean is in a bottle, and how are they making it flow so seamlessly into abstraction? Thinking about the objects and arrangement of images, and how it made the fantastical look real, was mindblowing. In particular, I remember flipping through a magazine and seeing a spread of images of an invisible person in a suit. How were they able to remove the exposed parts of the body and show the background beneath??

Working on these excercises, I've found approaching image manipulation from this angle to be mindblowing in a... different way. Part of me thinks, "It's all just pixels, that stuff I found so cool before isn't that magical", and at the same time another part realizes there's still so much here I have yet to understand.
