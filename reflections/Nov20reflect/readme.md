This week I tried to get a Unity project set up with AR. I was under the understanding that this was accomplishable without Vuforia (thus, without paying for Vuforia) due to recent Unity changes. I downloaded and important some demo AR scenes, but I just have a BUNCH of errors about things not found. I am looking at Vuforia now as well and watching some videos to try to figure out what to do, but at the least I have a project started and some demos downloaded
I'm at ICIDS this week, and just saw a project involving a physical handmade book that features AR elements. One thing that really stuck out to me was how they turned a design challenge into another layer of the experience. Basically, they had a map with black blocks of paint on it. These markings make the AR functionality reliable and responsive. However, just painting them for the sake of AR would feel like a sacrifice to the overall experience for the sake of getting a certain function to work. Instead, they used heat sensitive paint, and when you hold your hand or something warm over it, the black fades to clear and secret messages are revealed.
